## MySoft Health Data Analytics vInternship 2022

Big Data Analytics on Healthcare is currently in top demand in the software industries as the health data (EHR, PHR,
EMR, etc.) increased exponentially over the past decade, with growing data repositories across healthcare systems. The
leverage of the rising Big Data to discover the knowledge and insights of data required prior skills and expertise in
data pre-processing, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and programming languages as well. Applications of big
data analytics on health can improve the patient-based service, detect spreading diseases earlier, generate new insights
into disease mechanisms, monitor the quality of the medical and healthcare institutions as well as provide better
treatment methods.
